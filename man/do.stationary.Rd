\title{Automatic stationary transformation}
\usage{
do.stationary(data, period)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Series being differenced.}

\item{period}{Period of the series.}
}
\value{
Stationary transformation
\itemize{
\item ddata: data after differencing
\item mean: mean correction
\item differences:
\itemize{
\item lag: ddata(t)=data(t)-data(t-lag)
\item order: order of the differencing
}
}
}
\description{
Stationary transformation of a series by simple differencing of lag 1.
Automatic processing (identification of the order of the differencing) based on auto-correlations and on mean correction.
The series should not be seasonal.
